# Kaique Brazil.

Software engineer focused on backend systems, with strong experience in **MMORPG-related projects** and real-time services.

I mainly work on backend architecture, business logic, data consistency, concurrency, and integrations.  
Although backend is my primary focus, I’m comfortable working across the stack when the project requires it.

---

## Core stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js
- **Desktop:** Tauri, Electron
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Infra / OS:** Linux, Docker
- **Other languages:** C#, C++, Rust (practical knowledge)

## What I usually build

- Backend systems for **MMORPGs** and online games  
- Administrative dashboards and internal tools  
- Payment integrations, webhooks, and background jobs  
- Systems focused on idempotency, atomic transactions, and reliability  
- Desktop launchers and tooling for game ecosystems

## Artificial Intelligence (Applied)

I’m interested in AI from a practical and engineering-oriented perspective.

I focus on applying AI to real systems, not demos or theory-heavy experiments, including:
- Automation of internal workflows and operational tasks  
- Intelligent tooling for dashboards and administrative systems  
- Data analysis and pattern extraction from game and system telemetry  
- AI-assisted moderation, detection, and support tooling  
- LLM integration for internal tools, validation, and developer productivity  

AI is treated as part of the backend ecosystem, not a separate layer.

## Interests

- Backend architecture and long-running systems  
- MMORPG servers and game infrastructure  
- Desktop applications (Tauri / Electron)  
- Artificial Intelligence applied to production systems  
- Performance, stability, and maintainable codebases

---

## Work philosophy

- Simple code scales better  
- Predictability over cleverness  
- Failures should be handled explicitly  
- Infrastructure and backend deserve first-class design

---

## Notes

Most of my work is currently private or internal.  
I plan to publish more projects and experiments over time.
